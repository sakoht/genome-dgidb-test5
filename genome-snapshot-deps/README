This meta-package should install all software required for the genome snapshot to function.  
Because the snapshot includes UR and Workflow, those are not included in this package. 

It depends on several other meta-packages which represent several categories of software used at TGI:
genome-snapshot-deps-perl           Externally developed Perl modules.
genome-snapshot-deps-r              Externally developed R packages.
genome-snapshot-deps-apps-external  Other externally developed applications.
genome-snapshot-deps-apps-internal  Internally developed independent applications and libraries.

This meta-package, and those above, are versioned with YYYY.MM.DD-N.

Updates to anything under those meta-packages should result in those packages being rebuild (eventually automatically).  
That should in turn result in this package being rebuilt automatically with a new version/date.

TGI Sytems will ensure that updates to this package are propagated to the internal computer cluster.
Currently, this process is manual, so put in a ticket as this needs to occur.
