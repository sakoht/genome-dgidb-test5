This meta-package should install all software required for the genome snapshot to function.  
Because the snapshot includes UR and Workflow, those are not included in this package. 

It depends on several other meta-packages which represent several categories of software used at TGI:
genome-snapshot-deps-perl           Externally developed Perl modules.
genome-snapshot-deps-r              Externally developed R packages.
genome-snapshot-deps-apps-external  Other externally developed applications.
genome-snapshot-deps-apps-internal  Internally developed independent applications and libraries.

This meta-package, and those above, are versioned with YYYY.MM.DD-N.

Updates to anything under those meta-packages should result in those packages being rebuild (eventually automatically).  
That should in turn result in this package being rebuilt automatically with a new version/date.

TGI Sytems will ensure that updates to this package are propagated to the internal computer cluster.
Currently, this process is manual, so put in a ticket as this needs to occur.

Each of the four subordinate meta-packages have the same structure as this package.

Features:
* One or more "debian" directories will exist, either called "debian" or named for a specific distribution, like "ubuntu-lucid" or "ubuntu-precise".
* Where we have directories which are not "debian", there is a "debian" symlink which points to our current default distro.
* Several files will exist for each $dist:
    * $dist-control-template    The content of the debian/control file, with a placeholder for the actual dependencies.
    * $dist-list                The list of packages to be mixed into the $dist-control-template.
    * $dist-parent              If this is a subordinate meta-package, the name of the parent meta-package.
    * $dist-update.pl           A script to merge the above, and rebulid the $dist directory.  Usually a symlink to a common debian-update-shared.pl. 
* There is often also a "base-list", which has the names of the softare units in their native form. 
* A README explaining how to approach packaging.
