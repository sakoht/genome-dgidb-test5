Genome - pipelines, tools, and data managment for genomics

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Genome;

 # modules in the Genome namespace will now dynamically load

 @i = Genome::InstrumentData::Illumina->get(...);
 $m = Genome::Model::SomaticVariation->create(...);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the base namespace module for the Genome software tree.

That tree has several primary components:

 Genome::Model:         a data-modeling pipeline system for genomics

 Genome::Model::Tools   a tree of tools and tool wrappers with >1000 components

 Genome::*              a variety of patient and sample tracking classes with an RDBMS back-end

Only the tools system is currently released.  

See B<gmt> for a complete inventory of all tool packages, and for command-line access to
those tools.
