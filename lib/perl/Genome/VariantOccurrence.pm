# Talked to charris... it seems there are ~100 rows in this table. This is old validation data. What needs to happen is that this data
# should be imported into the new Genome::Model::Variant, Genome::Model::BuildVariant, Genome::Model::VariantValidation schema.
# This will take a little manual work as we do not have the full annotation for these variants handy so we need to re-annotate these lines 
# and format them to be uploaded into the new table set. This will take some manual munging but nothing too bad
# Once this is done we can drop this table and this class.
