Capture builds generate specific metrics for on/off target alignment and duplication.  In addition, RefCov runs at multiple minimum depth filters to evaluate coverage of each region of interest.  General coverage metrics are then summarized at each minimum depth.  This tool will take multiple builds and consolidate all the metrics for each build subject into two output file.  One for alignment metrics and one for coverage metrics.
