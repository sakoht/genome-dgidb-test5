This script counts bases with sufficient coverage in the ROIs of each gene from given wiggle track
format files, and categorizes them into - AT, CG (non-CpG), and CpG counts. It also adds
up these base-counts across all ROIs of each gene for each sample, but covered bases that lie
within overlapping ROIs are not counted more than once towards these total counts.

=item --roi-file

=over 8

=item The regions of interest (ROIs) of each gene are typically regions targeted for sequencing or
  are merged exon loci (from multiple transcripts) of genes with 2-bp flanks (splice junctions).
  For per-gene base counts, an overlapping base will be counted each time it appears in an ROI of
  the same gene. To avoid this, be sure to merge together overlapping ROIs of the same gene.
  BEDtools' mergeBed can help if used per gene.

=back

=item --reference-sequence

=over 8

=item The reference sequence in FASTA format. If a reference sequence index is not found next to
  this file (a .fai file), it will be created.

=back

=item --wig-list

=over 8

=item Provide a file containing sample names and the wiggle track format file locations for each.
  Use the tab-delimited format [sample_name wig_file] per line. Additional columns like clinical
  data are allowed, but ignored. The sample_name must be the same as the tumor sample names used
  in the MAF file (16th column, with the header Tumor_Sample_Barcode).

=back

=item --output-dir

=over 8

=item Specify an output directory where the following will be created/written:
  roi_covgs: Subdirectory containing per-ROI covered base counts for each sample.
  gene_covgs: Subdirectory containing per-gene covered base counts for each sample.
  total_covgs: File containing the overall non-overlapping coverages per sample.
