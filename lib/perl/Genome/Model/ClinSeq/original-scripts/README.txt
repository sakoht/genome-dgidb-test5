#COMPLETED TASKS
#As code writing tasks are completed, summarize them here
#Each of the following has been integrated into a single 'ClinSeq pipeline' - i.e. everything here gets run by a single command initiated for a single patient
#- Create methods to obtain and perform basic sanity checks on somatic variation and RNA-seq genome models
#- Summarize SNV lists.  Identify the subsets of SNVs that are protein coding relevant - produce a compact summary of each
#- Summarize InDel lists.  Similar to the summary for SNVs
#- Annotation of SNV and InDel lists at the gene level to identify potentially clinically relevant gene categories (e.g. kinases, druggable, etc.)
#- Create a 'database' of useful gene categories (kinases, phosphatases, etc.) using GO, DrugBank, etc.
#- Create method to intersect arbitrary lists of candidate genes with gene categories of interest
#- Create methods to parse and import DrugBank data and report on the drug interactions for candidate mutated, amplified, over-expressed genes
#- Create filtered versions of DrugBank that remove spurious or non-cancer relevant drug-gene interactions
#- Create method to identify copy number amplified and deleted regions on a gene-by-gene basis
#- Create visualizations of copy number results that are genome-wide, chromosome-by-chromosome, and specific genes or regions of the genome

#- Create visualizations of the most highly expressed genes as well as a predefined set of genes of interest
#- Create code to visualize chromosome ideograms and identify the cytoband of any gene or set of coordinates (in the format recognized by pathologists)
#- Automate creation of clonality plots
#- Automate identification of WGS, Exome and RNAseq datasets that have completed sequencing and are ready for ClinSeq analysis
#- Create methods to extract and parse the complete ClinicalTrials.gov database

#TODO / FEATURE WISH LIST
#- Summary stats.
#  - Data quality
#    - Stats from reference alignment build (reports directory of the reference build dir):
#      - lane count: 	5 
#      - input base count: 	212.587 Gb 
#      - haploid coverage: 	75.281 
#      - dbSNP % Concordance:   93.6585 	samtools r599 filtered by snp-filter v1 
#  - #SNVs, #tier 1,2,3, WGS. vs. Exome, etc.

#    - i.e. what is the mutation rate per megabase: total tier 1, non-synonymous tier1, synonymous tier 1, total all tiers, etc


#- Create vcf formatted version of all SNVs combined, then tier 1,2,3 individually
#- Get all BAM read counts for all SNVs for convenience in downstream analysis (WGS, Exome & RNAseq) (Tumor and Normal)
#  - Create a grand list of all SNV coords from WGS and Exome, note whether each came from WGS, Exome or BOTH, Tier, read counts from all BAMs

#- RNA-seq variant validation
#  - BAM read counts ... WGS, Exome, RNA
#  - Cufflinks expression.  FPKM + percentile
#  - Assess RNA-seq BAM read counts for Tier 2,3 SNVs.  High values might indicate an erroneous classification as Tier 2,3.  In theory RNA-seq should only cover Tier 1 ... 
#- RNA-seq outlier analysis
#  - Differential / relative comparisons to other samples / tumors of the same type
#- SVs.  Annotation strategies, validation, filtering
#- RNA-seq gene fusions
#  - Tophat fusion, Chimera scan
#- Previously discovered variants

#  - Find the genes that overlap these regions
#- Enhanced SNV annotation
#  - Sift, PolyPHEN, or similar
#  - SNPeff

#  - Summarize for each event list, how many genes belong to each catergory

#- Summary of TopHat RNA-seq alignment results
#  - Summarize read mapping, known vs. novel junctions, proportion of reads mapping across junctions, proportion of MT mapping reads
#- Druggable genes analysis
#  - 
#  - Are there any mutations that are in a kinase where that kinase itself is not druggable but:
#    - the region mutated is homologous to a mutation site in another kinase
#    - e.g. A HER2 mutation in a kinase domain and the corresponding region of that kinase domain is mutated in EGFR in another cancer type etc.
#    - Suggests that we could use an EGFR inhibitor to treat patients with this HER2 mutation.
#    - In general establish the cross-reactivity of kinase inhibitors or links that can be made between kinases by recurrence of mutation sites.

#CLINSEQ - CLINICAL SEQUENCING REPORTS
#Executive summary
#- The most clinically relevant observations
#- The highest priority druggable events and diagnostic / prognostic observations
#- Summarize sample and data QC only if there are serious concerns that effect interpretation of the results

#Detailed decision tree summary
#- The positive/negative status of all steps in the decision tree
#- Where positive, summarize the event and the confidence we can assign to it and the resulting treatment recommendation
#- Where negative, summarize the power we had to assess that branch of the tree (e.g. no kinase mutations were detected but WGS coverage was low)
#- How deeply into the tree did we have to traverse to achieve a high scoring positive observation
#- The structure of the tree may have cancer site (or even subtype) specific properties
#- The structure of the tree will evolve as we go through the ClinSeq process with increasing numbers of patients
#  - For example, for cancer type X we may learn over time that mutations are the highest prioroty types of events but in cancer type Y it may be focal amplifications
#  - The initial structure of the tree will be based on existing knowledge from the literature and consulting with medical experts for each cancer type
#  - As ClinSeq data becomes available, we can informatically refactor the decision trees (e.g. by machine learning approaches)
#- The major branches of the tree might be: druggable, prognostic, diagnostic, treatment response, discovery
#- Each branch has sub-branches that effectively ask questions that drill down to progressively more detailed inquiries
#  - e.g. Is there a somatic mutation? Affecting protein sequence? Does the gene have an approved drug? At a known pathological site that responds to the drug?
#  - For each question, if the answer is NO, further questions may be asked that may still lead to a clinical action (but likely a lower priority one) 

#Clinical data summary
#- What do we need to know about the patient tumor sample(s) to help us interpret and maximize the value of the genome sequencing and analysis?
#- Some info from the can be directly assessed/corroborated by the WGS, Exome, RNAseq analysis...
#  - e.g. HER2 protein expression status from clinic -> HER2 genome amplification status from WGS, RNA expression status from RNA-seq
#  - e.g. BCR-ABL translocation status from clinic -> exact structure of translocation in both the genome and transcriptome from WGS and RNA-seq respectively
#  - and so on, there are many, many things being done in the clinic that we can verify and in some cases we can get a higher resolution assessment...
#- Pathology - show FFPE H&E image for the tumor.  If LCM was used, show the slide before/after LCM
#- Other clinical data on the sample. e.g. For breast cancer, results from ER, PR, HER2 staining
#- If sorting was used on the tumor cells (e.g. in ALL) - summarize the sort efficiency
#- Comments on expected purity and heterogeneity from the pathologist, surgeon, oncologist perspective
#- Comments on prior treatment status of the patient (what chemotherapy have they received before some procurement) from oncologist
#- Cytogenetics. Overall karyotype status.  Specific events assayed for the tumor type.  
#- e.g. overall genome stability, deletions, amplifications, translocations, microsatellite instability, etc.

#- Candidate molecular event and gene lists from which clinically actionable events will be drawn
#- Where 'clinically actionable' implies some suggestion or modification of patient treatment
#- Many possible forms:
#  - Therapy that targets an activating mutation, amplified gene, over-expressed gene, activated pathway, etc.
#  - Observations of prognostic value -> e.g. low, medium, high risk of progression/metastasis
#  - Observations of diagnostic value -> subtyping of tumors
#  - Observations that influence dosing of therapies that are already part of standard of care
#- Observations relating to existing clinical trials

#Discovery summary
#- Observations that are not immediately clinically actionable but have a potential value in the development of novel therapies
