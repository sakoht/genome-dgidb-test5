#Data paths


#TODO / Feature wish list
#- Summary stats.tsv -> # SNVs, #tier 1,2,3, WGS. vs. Exome, etc.
#- CNV amplified / deleted + over-expressed / under-expressed
#- WGS vs. Exome Venn Diagrams : For SNVs & Indels
#- Mutated and expressed vs. not expressed summary
#- RNA-seq variant validation
#  - BAM read counts ... WGS, Exome, RNA
#  - Cufflinks expression.  FPKM + percentile
#- RNA-seq outlier analysis
#  - Differential / relative comparisons to other samples / tumors of the same type
#- SVs.  Annotation strategies, validation, filtering
#- RNA-seq gene fusions
#  - Tophat fusion, Chimera scan
#- Previously discovered variants
#- Germline variants
#- CNVseg -> partial gene amplifications / deletions
#- Overlap of observed mutations with Cosmic / OMIM sites (use MUSIC?)
#- Overlap of observed mutations with TGI recurrent sites
