#RNA-seq Build Dir (e.g. /gscmnt/gc8001/info/model_data/2881643231/build117377906/)
#Annotation Build Dir (e.g. /gscmnt/ams1102/info/model_data/2771411739/build106409619/)

  Intro:
  This script summarizes results from a tophat alignment directory and writes resulting stats and figures to a working directory

  Details:
  --reference_fasta_file          Reference fasta file that was used for Tophat mapping
  --tophat_alignment_dir          The 'alignment' dir created by a Tophat run
  --reference_annotations_dir     Directory containing the reference junctions to be compared against
                                  For example: /gscmnt/sata132/techd/mgriffit/reference_annotations/hg19/ALL.Genes.junc
  --working_dir                   Directory where results will be stored
  --verbose                       To display more output, set to 1
  --clean                         To clobber the top dir and create everything from scratch, set to 1
