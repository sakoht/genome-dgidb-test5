<p class="help_text">
First, search for the models, samples, etc that interest you. Then,
click on "create a new project" in the project box (red below). You
will be prompted to name the project.

The project box lists some of your projects and the number of items they contain.
You can click on "see all" to see the full list (there is also a link on our main page http://imp/search).
From the full list, you can see a detailed view of a project where you can remove items.

<p class="help_text">
If you would like someone else to be able to find a project easily, just search for them by user name
and drag them into the project. That project will now appear in their project list.
