This "inc" directory is for modules/libraries that are only
used during the build/make/test process.  The should not
be deployed.  Makefile.PL makes this directory get included
during any of the "make" commands.

The Module directory is from inc::Module::Install.  It's all
auto-generated code so it should not be modified.

Also, Test::TAP::Model::LSF lives here.  It may not be the
best place for it, but it works for now
