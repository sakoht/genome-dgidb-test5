=head1 View Interface

=over 4

=item create

The constructor requires the following params to be specified as key-value pairs:

=over 4

=item subject_class_name
    
The class of subject this viewer will view.  Constant for any given viewer,
but this may be any abstract class up-to UR::Object itself.
    
=item perspective

Used to describe the layout engine which gives logical content
to the viewer.

=item toolkit

The specific (typically graphical) toolkit used to construct the UI.
Examples are Gtk, Gkt2, Qt, Tk, HTML, Curses.

=back

=item delete

The destructor deletes subordinate components, and the related widget, 
removing them all from the view of the user.

=item show

For stand-alone viewers, this puts the viewer in its own window.  For 
viewers which are part of a larger viewer, this makes the viewer widget
visible in the parent.

=item hide

Makes the viewer invisible.  This means hiding the window, or hiding the viewer
widget in the parent widget for subordinate viewers.

=item show_modal 

This method shows the viewer in a window, and only returns after the window is closed.
It should only be used for viewers which are a full interface capable of closing itself when done.

=item get_visible_aspects / add_visible_aspect / remove_visible_aspect

An "aspect" is some characteristic of the "subject" which is rendered in the 
viewer.  Properties of an aspect specifyable in the above methods are:

=over 4

=item method

The name of the method on the subject which returns the data to be rendered.

=item position

The position within the viewer of this aspect.  The actual meaning will
depend on the logic behind the perspective.

=item perspective

If a subordinate viewer will be used to render this aspect, this perspective
will be used to for that viewer.

=head1 Toolkit Interface

=over 4

=item toolkit

A class method indicating what toolkit is used to render the view.
Possible values are Gtk, and hopefully Gtk2, Tk, Qt, HTML, Curses, text, etc.

=item get_widget

Returns the "widget" which is the rendered view.  The actual object
type depends on the toolkit named above.

=item _toolkit_class

Returns the name of a class which is derived from UR::Object::Toolkit
which implements certain utility methods for viewers of a given toolkit.

    my $self = shift;

=pod

=head1 Perspective Interface

When writing a new viewer, these methods should be implemented to 
handle the tasks described.  The class can be named anything, though
the recommended naming structure for a viewer is something like:

     Acme::Rocket::Viewer::FlightPath::Gtk2
     \          /           \    /      \
     subject class        perspective    toolkit
      
A module like ::FlightPath::Gtk2 might keep most logic in
Acme::Rocket::Viewer::FlightPath, and only toolkit specifics in
Gtk2, but this is not required as long as the module functions.

=over 4

=item _create_widget

This should be implemented in a given perspective/toolkit module to actually
create the GUI using the appropriate toolkit.  It will be called before the
specific subject is known, so all widget creation which is subject-specific 
should be done in _bind_subject().

=item _bind_subject

This method has a default implementation which does a general subscription
to changes on the subject.  It propbably does not need to be overridden
in custom viewers.

This does additional changes to the widget when a subject is set, unset, or 
switched.  Implementations should take an undef subject, and also expect
to un-bind a previously existing subject if there is one set. 

=item _update_widget_from_subject

If when the subject changes this method will be called on all viewers
which render the changed aspect of the subject.

=item _update_subject_from_widget

When the widget changes, it should call this method to save the GUI changes
to the subject.
