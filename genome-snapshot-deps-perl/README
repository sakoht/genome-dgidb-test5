This meta-package represents all externally developed Perl modules required for the GMS snapshot to run.
NOTE: Because UR and Workflow are part of the snapshot, they are not in the dependency list.

To add or remove *external* Perl modules from the TGI cluster, edit the "ubuntu-lucid-list".  It contains the names of all required Perl Debian packages in alphabetical order. 

By convention Foo::Bar::Baz will have the Debian package name "libfoo-bar-baz-perl".

If you are adding a dependency should make sure that the Debian package for the Perl module in question exists:
 apt-cache search libfoo-bar-baz-perl

Then attempt to install it on your local machine to try it out:
 sudo apt-get install libfoo-bar-baz-perl

Then add it to this file, in alphabetical position:
 ubuntu-lucid-list

This is what the apipe-ci server will do:
* run ubuntu-lucid-update.pl to update the ubuntu-lucid/ directory
* rebuild the genome-snapshot-deps-perl package
* put it into the internal repository

Systems will ensure that, when there is a new deps package available, blades and workstations update themselves.
