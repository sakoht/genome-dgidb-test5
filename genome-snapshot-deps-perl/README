This meta-package represents all externally developed Perl modules required for the snapshot to run.

Because UR and Workflow are part of the snapshot, they are not in the dependency list.

To begin depending on a new Perl module:
- determine the name of the Debian package (Foo::Bar::Baz is libfoo-bar-baz-perl)
- install it locally to make sure it works
- put the name(s) in the "debian-list" file in alphabetical positions
- commit and push the change

The apipe-ci server will run debian-update.pl to update the package for the changes, 
and will push out a new package, along with a new genome-snapshot-deps master package.
