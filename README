WHERE TO PUT CODE:

Perl:

 The modules go under lib/perl.

 In the shipit branch, the code is divided up like the C/C++ standard below.
 We will move to the new structure as soon as it's easy to develop and test there.
 

C/C++/Java:

 These are in a new structure where each gets its own top-level directory.
 These are "sub modules", meaning each gets its own subordinate git repo.
 
 These directories start out empty, but you can get their code by doing:

    git submodule update --init $DIRNAME

  Updates to sub-modules must be committed and pushed independently.

    Example:

    git submodule update --init cmpbed
    cd cmpbed
    # change things
    git commit 
    git push origin master

  To make a new one, run:

    create-c-project $DIRNAME

XML/XSL:
 
 All of the web server infrastructure is under genome-webserver in both branches.

 For the specific entity views, they live under Genome/xsl in the master branch,
 and under various package dirs in the shipit branch, depending on what they view.

R:

 R libraries live next-to the Perl module which provides an interface to them
 for the rest of the system.
