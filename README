WHERE TO PUT CODE:


Perl, Java, Ruby:

 The modules go under lib/$LANG.

 In the shipit branch, the code is divided up like the C/C++ standard below.
 We will move to the new structure as soon as it's easy to develop and test there.
 

R:

 R libraries live next-to the Perl module which provides an interface to them
 for the rest of the system.
 

XML/XSL:
 
 These currently live under Genome/, but will relocated when we break out the web app.


C/C++:

 These are in a new structure where each gets its own top-level directory.
 These are "sub modules", meaning each gets its own subordinate git repo.
 
 These directories start out empty, but you can get their code by doing:

    git submodule update --init $DIRNAME

  Updates to sub-modules must be committed and pushed independently.

    Example:

    git submodule update --init cmpbed
    cd cmpbed
    # change things
    git commit 
    git push origin master

  To make a new one, run:

    create-c-project $DIRNAME
