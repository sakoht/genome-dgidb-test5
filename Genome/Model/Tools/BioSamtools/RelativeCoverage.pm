[2] Percent of Reference Bases Covered
[3] Total Number of Reference Bases
[4] Total Number of Covered Bases
[5] Number of Missing Bases
[6] Average Coverage Depth
[7] Standard Deviation Average Coverage Depth
[8] Median Coverage Depth
[9] Number of Gaps
[10] Average Gap Length
[11] Standard Deviation Average Gap Length
[12] Median Gap Length
[13] Min. Depth Filter
